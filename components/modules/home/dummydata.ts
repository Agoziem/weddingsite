Our story is that which clearly depicts that God is always intentional with his children and their relationships too. 
We didn't plan to meet each other, we didn't have anything to connect us together, we met at a time when we were both not thinking of any relationship at all.

We have a popular saying amongst ourselves that said thus;
"God is the one who is writing our script, he started it, he will surely make all things beautiful in his time."

We met in January 19th 2021 for the first time and from that day, our connection looked so divine and we didn't struggle to accept each other's friendship and company. We started as just good friends, we only officially became lovers 2 years later.

Within these years, it was one of the most beautiful and genuine friendships we had ever experienced. It was so pure that it resulted in our exponential growth in all ramifications. 
We are a proof that real relationships do not affect your walk with God but rather help it become better.

We kept our relationship private from everyone until when we knew we wanted to marry each other. It was not a secret friendship but a very private and conservative one.

We made God the "umpire" of our Relationship and his word our absolute authority. Nothing was allowed to jeopardize this resolution at all.

We didn't do relationship the popular way, everything just flowed naturally and genuinely. 
No public proposal or dramatic proposals, we knew our hearts were beating for one another, we just let everything flow and we started involving our loved ones and leaders. They all approved it and gave their consent.

We have both learned that relationship can be done God's way and that the values of the Kingdom of God can be seen in a romantic relationship.

We are getting married to continue growing in God's purpose for our lives. The mandate of God upon us is the major driving force for this union.
We believe that our union will bring about exponential growth and increase for us, the work of God in our care, and everyone under our leadership. Hence the caption "Auxano".

We pray that God will continue to guide us and strengthen us for the journey ahead. 
Thank you for agreeing to support us as we do this together. 

Finally, Nonso loves Adanna deeply and Adanna loves Nonso unapologetically.

Auxano!
